sioux_tech_radar
================

Survey and reporting engine for a colleague-sourced Technology Radar on embedded software development.


Target audience
---------------
Sioux software developers and architects. This means they have opinions, they are skilled, and are not children. 
They can handle responsibility, and poor security. Although they will probably rick-rol you, they will not break your
stuff.
